voice.start_listening()

# Execute tasks
task_coordinator = TaskCoordinator()
result = task_coordinator.execute_task("open excel and create a new workbook")
print(result)
```

### üé§ Voice Control Usage

```python
from jarvis_ai import VoiceInterface

# Initialize voice interface
voice = VoiceInterface()

# Setup push-to-talk (default: space key)
voice.setup_push_to_talk()

# Start voice interaction
voice.start_listening()
# Say: "Buka Excel dan buat workbook baru"
```

### üîä Text-to-Speech Usage

```python
from jarvis_ai.voice import TTSManager

# Initialize TTS with Indonesian support
tts = TTSManager()

# Speak in Indonesian
tts.speak("Halo, saya Jarvis AI, asisten virtual Anda")
```

### üìä Office Automation with Jarvis AI

```python
from jarvis_ai.office import OfficeAutomation

# Initialize office automation
office = OfficeAutomation()

# Excel operations
office.excel.create_workbook()
office.excel.write_data('A1', 'Hello Jarvis AI')
office.excel.save_as('jarvis_report.xlsx')

# Word operations
office.word.create_document()
office.word.add_text('Laporan dibuat oleh Jarvis AI')
office.word.save_as('jarvis_document.docx')
```

### üîß Windows System Tools with Jarvis AI

```python
from jarvis_ai.system import SystemManager

# Initialize system manager
system = SystemManager()

# Package management
system.winget.search("notepad")
system.winget.install("Microsoft.WindowsNotepad")

# PowerShell operations
result = system.powershell.execute("Get-Process")
system_info = system.powershell.get_system_info()

# Process management
processes = system.process.list_all()
top_cpu = system.process.get_top_by_cpu()
```

### üß¨ Learning & Evolution with Jarvis AI

```python
from jarvis_ai import LearningEngine

# Initialize learning engine
learning = LearningEngine()

# Train models
learning.train_command_classifier()
learning.update_preference_clusters()
learning.optimize_responses()

# Get insights
insights = learning.get_performance_insights()
print(f"Learning progress: {insights}")
```

## ü§ñ Run Jarvis AI

You can run Jarvis AI in multiple ways:
