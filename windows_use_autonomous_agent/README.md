**Windows-Use** is a powerful automation agent that interact directly with the Windows at GUI layer. It bridges the gap between AI Agents and the Windows OS to perform tasks such as opening apps, clicking buttons, typing, executing shell commands, and capturing UI state all without relying on traditional computer vision models. Enabling any LLM to perform computer automation instead of relying on specific models for it.

voice_input.setup_push_to_talk(key='space')

# Start listening
text = voice_input.listen_with_push_to_talk()
print(f"You said: {text}")
```

### üîä TTS Usage

```python
from windows_use.tools.tts_piper import TTSPiper

# Initialize TTS
tts = TTSPiper()

# Speak text in Indonesian
tts.speak("Halo, saya adalah asisten AI Anda")
```

### üìä Office Automation Usage

```python
from windows_use.office import ExcelHandler, WordHandler

# Excel automation
excel = ExcelHandler()
excel.open_excel()
workbook = excel.create_workbook()
excel.write_cell(workbook, 'Sheet1', 'A1', 'Hello World')
excel.save_workbook(workbook, 'output.xlsx')

# Word automation
word = WordHandler()
word.open_word()
doc = word.create_document()
word.write_text(doc, 'This is automated text')
word.save_document(doc, 'output.docx')
```

### üîß Windows System Tools Usage

```python
from windows_use.tools.winget import WingetManager
from windows_use.tools.ps_shell import PowerShellManager
from windows_use.tools.process import ProcessManager

# Package management
winget = WingetManager()
packages = winget.search_package("notepad")
winget.install_package("Microsoft.WindowsNotepad")

# PowerShell operations
ps = PowerShellManager()
result = ps.execute_command("Get-Process")
system_info = ps.get_system_info()

# Process management
proc_mgr = ProcessManager()
processes = proc_mgr.list_processes()
top_processes = proc_mgr.get_top_processes_by_cpu()
```

### üß¨ Self-Evolving Agent Usage

```python
from windows_use.evolution import EvolutionEngine, EvolutionConfig
from windows_use.evolution.memory import ExperienceType

# Initialize evolution engine
config = EvolutionConfig(evaluation_interval=1800)  # 30 minutes
engine = EvolutionEngine(config)

# Start evolution
await engine.start()

# Record experiences
await engine.record_experience(
    experience_type=ExperienceType.TASK_EXECUTION,
    context="User requested file search",
    action="Executed search command",
    outcome="Found 15 files in 2.3 seconds",
    success=True,
    confidence=0.9
)

# Get insights
insights = await engine.get_insights()
print(f"Success rate: {insights['performance']['success_rate']}")
```

* [ ] **Context-aware prioritization** : rank UI elements based on relevance to the task at hand.

### üí° User Experience

* [ ] **Reduce latency** : optimize to improve response time between GUI interaction.
* [ ] **Polish command interface** : make it easier to write, speak, or type commands through a simplified UX layer.
* [ ] **Better error handling & recovery** : ensure graceful handling of edge cases and unclear instructions.

### üß™ Evaluation

* [ ] **LLM evaluation benchmarks** ‚Äî track performance across different models and benchmarks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution

Agent interacts directly with your Windows OS at GUI layer to perform actions. While the agent is designed to act intelligently and safely, it can make mistakes that might bring undesired system behaviour or cause unintended changes. Try to run the agent in a sandbox envirnoment.
