**Windows-Use** is a powerful automation agent that interact directly with the Windows at GUI layer. It bridges the gap between AI Agents and the Windows OS to perform tasks such as opening apps, clicking buttons, typing, executing shell commands, and capturing UI state all without relying on traditional computer vision models. Enabling any LLM to perform computer automation instead of relying on specific models for it.

## ‚ú® New Features

- **Context-aware routing** between different processing backends

### üìä Office Automation
- **Excel Automation** via COM (pywin32)
  - Workbook and worksheet management
  - Cell operations and data manipulation
  - Chart insertion and formatting
- **Word Automation** via COM
  - Document creation and editing
  - Text formatting and styling
  - PDF export functionality
- **PowerPoint Automation** via COM
  - Slide creation and management
  - Content insertion and editing
  - Presentation export

### üîí Security & Safety
- **Guardrails Engine** for action validation
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** approval system
- **Rate limiting** and security policies
- **Action logging** and audit trails

### üìà Observability
- **Structured JSON logging** with context tracking
- **Automatic screenshot capture** for debugging
- **Performance metrics** and monitoring
- **Session management** and error tracking

## üõ†Ô∏èInstallation Guide

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.12 or higher
- [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (or `pip`)
- Windows 10 or 11

### **Installation Steps**

**Install using `uv`:**

```bash
uv pip install windows-use
````

Or with pip:

```bash
pip install windows-use
```

**Install additional dependencies for new features:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** For Office automation features, ensure Microsoft Office is installed on your system.

## ‚öôÔ∏èBasic Usage

```python
# main.py
from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI
from windows_use.agent import Agent
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

llm=ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model='gemini-2.0-flash')
agent = Agent(llm=llm,use_vision=True)
query=input("Enter your query: ")
agent_result=agent.invoke(query=query)
print(agent_result.content)
```

### üé§ Voice Input Usage

```python
from windows_use.tools.voice_input import VoiceInput

# Initialize voice input with push-to-talk
voice_input = VoiceInput()
voice_input.setup_push_to_talk(key='space')

# Start listening
text = voice_input.listen_with_push_to_talk()
print(f"You said: {text}")
```

### üîä TTS Usage

```python
from windows_use.tools.tts_piper import TTSPiper

# Initialize TTS
tts = TTSPiper()

# Speak text in Indonesian
tts.speak("Halo, saya adalah asisten AI Anda")
```

### üìä Office Automation Usage

```python
from windows_use.office import ExcelHandler, WordHandler

# Excel automation
excel = ExcelHandler()
excel.open_excel()
workbook = excel.create_workbook()
excel.write_cell(workbook, 'Sheet1', 'A1', 'Hello World')
excel.save_workbook(workbook, 'output.xlsx')

# Word automation
word = WordHandler()
word.open_word()
doc = word.create_document()
word.write_text(doc, 'This is automated text')
word.save_document(doc, 'output.docx')
```

## ü§ñ Run Agent

You can use the following to run from a script:

```bash
python main.py
Enter your query: <YOUR TASK>
```

## Vision

Talk to your computer. Watch it get things done.

## Roadmap

### ü§ñ Agent Intelligence

* [ ] **Integrate memory** : allow the agent to remember past interactions made by the user.
* [ ] **Optimize token usage** : implement strategies like Ally Tree compression and prompt engineering to reduce overhead.
* [ ] **Simulate advanced human-like input** : enable accurate and naturalistic mouse & keyboard interactions across apps.
* [ ] **Support for local LLMs** : local models with near-parity performance to cloud-based APIs (e.g., Mistral, LLaMA, etc.).
* [ ] **Improve reasoning and planning** : enhance the agent's ability to break down and sequence complex tasks.

### üå≥ Ally Tree Optimization

* [ ] **Improve UI element detection** : automatically identify and prioritize essential, interactive components on screen.
* [ ] **Compress Ally Tree intelligently** : reduce complexity by pruning irrelevant branches.
* [ ] **Context-aware prioritization** : rank UI elements based on relevance to the task at hand.

### üí° User Experience

* [ ] **Reduce latency** : optimize to improve response time between GUI interaction.
* [ ] **Polish command interface** : make it easier to write, speak, or type commands through a simplified UX layer.
* [ ] **Better error handling & recovery** : ensure graceful handling of edge cases and unclear instructions.

### üß™ Evaluation

* [ ] **LLM evaluation benchmarks** ‚Äî track performance across different models and benchmarks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution

Agent interacts directly with your Windows OS at GUI layer to perform actions. While the agent is designed to act intelligently and safely, it can make mistakes that might bring undesired system behaviour or cause unintended changes. Try to run the agent in a sandbox envirnoment.
